- 👋 Hi, I’m @PetePatton
- 👀 I’m interested in developing API's and Automation with DriveWorks. I am a car guy as well. Spent 10 years working professionally as an Auto Technician. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, Http, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.  I am also working on Certifications in SolidWorks and DriveWorks. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that will help guide me to become a better developer. 
- 📫 How to reach me - PetePatton@P2CustomSolutions.com is my business email. This includes all kinds of custom design work including but not limited to mobile marketing, experiential, custom machine design, or industrial design work as needed.
-  I currently offer Engineering Design for Hire services through that email but am willing to collaborate on programming projects to increase my knowledge and capabilities as well as help you with your needs. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an Army Veteran, 5 years, 2 tours that went back to college at the age of 33 to get a Mechanical Engineering degree.  Now I am programming Design Automation with a focus on documenting workflows and procedures.
